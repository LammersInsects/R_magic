# R_magic
collection of custom R scripts

By Mark Lammers, MSc
PhD candidate, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam

[Currently, this is an empty work-in-progress repository. Scripts will be uploaded at some later point!]

The scripts cover, amongst others topics, the following:
- (Comparative) Genomics
- (Comparative) Transcriptomics
- Dataframe reformatting


All scripts are released under the GNU General Public Lisence v3.0
Each script specifies the publication it was written for in its header. If you use a scipt of mine for research purposes, please add the respective publication to your paper's reference list. Besides that, if you ever meet me: do offer me coffee ;-)
